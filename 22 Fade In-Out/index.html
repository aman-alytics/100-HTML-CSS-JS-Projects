        "Arrow fade out with no scroll adds a touch of elegance to user
        interfaces. By smoothly fading out navigation arrows when scrolling
        isn't possible, this design approach maintains a clean and uncluttered
        appearance while enhancing the user experience. The subtle disappearance
        of arrows when they are unnecessary preserves visual simplicity and
        promotes a more streamlined interaction, making navigation intuitive and
        visually appealing."
